### Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University (Coursera)

This Specialization covers the concepts and tools one will need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. The final Capstone Project allows someone to apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data.
