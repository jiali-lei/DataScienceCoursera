### Description of Reproducible Research

In this course I learned the ideas of reproducible research and reporting of statistical analyses. Topics covered include literate programming tools, evidence-based data analysis, and organizing data analyses. In this course I learned to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, publish reproducible documents to the web, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.

#### Course Content
