### Description of Practical Machine Learning

One of the most common tasks performed by data scientists and data analysts are prediction and machine learning. This course covers the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications. The course provides basic grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets, overfitting, and error rates. The course also introduces a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course covers the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.
