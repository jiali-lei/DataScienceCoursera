### Description of Statistical Inference

This course covers the fundamentals of statistical inference with a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. I learned to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and am able to use the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.
