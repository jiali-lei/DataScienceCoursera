### Introduction

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the U.S., EPA is tasked to setting national standards for the fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. This project explores the dataset from National Emission Inventory (NEI). 

### Data

The data for this project are available from the course website as a single zip file:

- [Data for Peer Assessment (29MB)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip)

The zip file contains two .rds files with PM2.5 emission data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008, and the source classification code table.

### Questions

The overall goal of this project is to explore the NEI database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the U.S. over the 10-year period 1999-2008. Outputs are in graphs to support the exploratory analysis.
