### Description of R Programming

In this course I learned how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. I learned how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment, and joined the discussion of generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. 

The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis and optimization will provide working examples.

In this repo, you'll find three of my programming projects:

1. Air Polution
2. Lexical Scoping
3. Hospital Quality
