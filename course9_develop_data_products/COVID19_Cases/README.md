### Introduction

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that feature a plot created with Plotly. I created a plot that shows the daily COVID19 cases in the U.S., and a map that shows the COVID19 cases and deaths in 50 states. The plots are interactive due to features that come with **Plotly**, feel free to play with them when you view the html presentaion.

To view the HTML, use the Rpub link below:

- [https://rpubs.com/jLei/covid19Cases](https://rpubs.com/jLei/covid19Cases)

Note: **covidCases.html** is too large of a file to be rendered by github.io; otherwise, you can navigate my github.io page from gh-pages branch.
